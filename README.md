Origins++ is an extensive collection of over 100 unique origins to fully expand the origins experience. Each origin comes with advantages, disadvantages, and powers to alter your playstyle.

## Mod Compatibility
- Origins++ includes built-in compatibility for certain items from select mods.
- Additionally, you can use [this datapack template](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support) to extend compatibility to other mods to further customise your play-through.
  
## Mod Loader Support
- **Fabric**: Origins (Fabric) provides the most stable experience with Origins++. Most bugs are likely related to Origins++ itself and so will be fixed.
- **Forge**: Although Origins (Forge) has been discontinued, Origins++ will still provide support on a best-effort basis. Please note than many issues are caused by Origins (Forge) itself, and so cannot be resolved by Origins++.

## Building
- To build the project, run either `gradlew buildFabric` or `gradlew buildForge`, depending on your chosen mod loader. The output `.jar` file will be located in the `fabric\build\libs` or `forge\build\libs` directory, respectively.


## Credits
- All credit for the original origins goes to their [respective creators](https://gist.github.com/QuantumXenon/d7ec9ceee0f8897410cff5088307f028), who retain the rights to their work. Special thanks to these authors for granting permission to include their origins in Origins++.
- I would also like to thank [Overgrown](https://github.com/0vergrown) and [Tigerblood](https://github.com/spaghettube) for their assistance on GitHub making improvements and resolving issues.
